## Overview

Bandit is a project for learning mask generation and image filling/inpainting
techniques.

The goal is to implement algorithms ranging from classical heuristics to deep
neural networks in an effort to learn image masks and how to fill/replace them.
This could be applied to segmentation, denoising, restoration,
watermark-removal, or other scenarios where a learned image mask could be
useful.
