## Overview

Bandit is a project for learning mask generation and image filling/inpainting
techniques.

The goal is to implement algorithms ranging from classical heuristics to deep
neural networks to tackle the task learnning image mask and filling/replacing
them. This could applied to segmentation, restoration, watermark-removal, or
other scenarios where a learned image mask could be useful.
