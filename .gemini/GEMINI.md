## Guidelines

Here are rules that you must ALWAYS follow:

* prefer using the `uv` cli for running or installing anything for python.
* prefer using the `cargo` cli for running or installing anything for rust.
* at the end of a request, if you have modified code please run `npx -y difit
--clean .` to have a user review the changes. if they leave comments please fix
them; otherwise you may complete your task.
