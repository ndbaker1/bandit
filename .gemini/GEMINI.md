## Guidelines

Here are rules that you must ALWAYS follow:

* prefer using the `uv` cli for running or installing anything for python.
* after testing a code change, please run `npx -y difit --clean .` to have a
user review the changes. if they leave comments please fix them; otherwise
continue with your work.
